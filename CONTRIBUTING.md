# Contribution guidelines
When you open a pull request, you are kindly asked to have the following requirements met:
- Please use commit comments, and don't spam commits. Else all your commits will have to be squashed
- Keep all functions in the `Proxus` namespace. Edit data/minecraft/tags/functions/tick.json accordingly.
- If you add or change any things, please also update the info.md file.
- Please don't open pull requests with features that change the game entirely, or for example lag the server a lot. Please always contact staff before even starting on this, else you might waste a lot of time.
